Classification
    Classification gives priority to certain types of traffic over others.
    Ways to classifying traffic: 
        #1 ACLs;
        #2 NBAR (Network Based Application Recognition) inspects layer 3, layer 4, and up to layer 7.
        #3 PCP/CoS (Priority Code Point/Class of Service) of 802.1q tag (layer 2).

    RFC 4954 offers some specefic recommendations to classify traffic:
        - Vioce traffic: EF (DSCP46)
        - Interactive video: AF4x (DSCP34/36/38)
        - Streaming video: AF3x (DSCP26/28/30)
        - High priority data: AF2x (DSCP18/20/22)
Queuing           
    When a device receives messages faster than forwards them out, new messages are placed in a queue and taken by a Scheduler later to transmit.
    Classified packets are queued in different queues.
    By default, queued messages will be forwarded in FIFO (First In First Out) manner.
    When a queue is full, new arriving packets will be dropped. This is called tail drop.
                     Queue (FIFO)
           Dropped   +----(queue is full)-+
          +--+ +--+  | +--+--+--+--+--+--+|
          |Pa| |Pa|  | |Pa|Pa|Pa|Pa|Pa|Pa||
          |ck| |ck|  | |ck|ck|ck|ck|ck|ck||
          |et| |et|  | |et|et|et|et|et|et||
          +--+ +--+  | +--+--+--+--+--+--+|
                     +--------------------+
                  (Tail Drop)
    Tail drop is harmful because it can lead to TCP global synchronization.
    RED (Random Early Detection) is introduced to prevent tail drop and TCP global synchronization.
    WRED (Weighted Random Early Detection) is an improved version, allows to control which packets are dropped depending on the traffic class.
        
Scheduling
    Theoritecally, a scheduler decides which queue traffic is forwarded from next. A popular scheduling method is Wieghted Round-Robin combining with CBWFQ.
    Round-robin - Pakets are taken fom each queue in order cyclically;
    Weighted    - More data is taken from high priority queues each time the scheduler reaches that queue;
    CBWFQ       - Class-Based Weighted Fair Queuing, guaranteeing each queuw a certain percentage of the interface's bandwidth.
                  Not ideal for voice/video because even the highest priority queues have to wait their turn in the scheduler, which adds delay & jitter.
    LLQ         - Low Latency Queue, designating one or more queues as strict priority queues (SPQ);
                  SPQ queues will be always taken the next packet until it is empty.
                  Best for voice/video traffic.
                  
Policing
    Drops or remark packets if the traffic rate goes over the configured rate. 
    Solve the downside of LLQ where schedulers are starving if there is always traffic in the designated SPQ.
    ISPs use policing to comply a rate/speed with a WAN service contract.
    
Shaping
    Buffers traffic in a queue if the traffic rate goes over the configured rate.  
    Shapping optimize delay of some traffic by delaying others.   
    Companies may deploy shaping on source traffic (custmor-edge-router) to ensure the traffic they send complies with a contract (limited service rate/speed) which may be enfoced in ISPs network by traffic polcing.
