Queuing: When congestion occurs, calssified data were buffered in different queues to wait for being taken by a Scheduler to transmit.
Scheduling: Theoritecally, a scheduler decides which queue traffic is forwarded from next. A popular scheduling method is Wieghted Round-Robin combining with CBWFQ.
  Round-robin = pakets are taken fom each queue in order cyclically;
  Weighted = more data is taken from high priority queues each time the scheduler reaches that queue;
  CBWFQ = Class-Based Weighted Fair Queuing, guaranteeing each queuw a certain percentage of the interface's bandwidth.
