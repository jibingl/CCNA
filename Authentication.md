# Authentication Protocols

## Open Authentication

## WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy)

## EAP (Extensible Authentication Protocol)
**EAP** is integrated with **802.1x**, which provides _port-based network access control_ (NAC).

Different EAP variations:  
Abb. | Names | Property | Decription |
-----|-------|----------|------------|
LEAP | Lightweight EAP | Cisco | Based on WEP, using dynamic WEP keys |
EAP-FAST | EAP Flexible Authentication via Secure Tunneling | Cisco | Establish TLS tunnel firstly, then authentication |
PEAP | Protected EAP | | Tunnel established by AS certificate |
EPA-TLS | EAP Transport Layer Secruity | | Mutual authentications at the very beginning |

```
  > Note: Since AS and supplicant exchange certificates and use them to authenticate each other, so no furter authentication happens in the TLS tunnel which is used to encrypt data transmission.
